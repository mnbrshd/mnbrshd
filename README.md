- 🧩 Multimodal AI (Vision × Language)  
- 🛠️ LLMOps & RAG systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- ⚙️ Model deployment using Docker, FastAPI, and Streamlit  
- 📦 Using vector stores (like Milvus) for scalable AI memory  

## 🚀 Featured Work
- **Smear Slide Analysis** using traditional CV + deep learning  
- **End-to-End RAG Pipelines** with Ollama, Milvus, LangChain  
- **Transcription Engines** using Whisper + faster-whisper for large audio datasets  
- **CLI + UI Tools** for batch inference and visualization of AI predictions  
- **PDF + Image Document Processing** using PaddleOCR and OpenCV

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Bash  
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain  
- **Tooling**: Docker, Milvus, Streamlit, FastAPI, Git, OpenCV  
- **Models**: Whisper, LLaVA, Stable Diffusion, Ollama models  
- **Infra**: NVIDIA GPUs, local + containerized deployments  

## 🎯 Interests
