# üëã Hi, I'm Muhammad Muneeb Arshad

I‚Äôm an AI Engineer and Researcher with a focus on building practical, scalable, and intelligent systems across domains. My work blends deep learning, computer vision, and NLP with an emphasis on real-world application and deployment.

## Current Focus
- Applied Machine Learning and Model Optimization  
- Multimodal AI (Vision √ó Language)  
- LLMOps & RAG systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- Model deployment using Docker, FastAPI, and Streamlit  
- Using vector stores (like Milvus) for scalable AI memory  

## Professional Work
- **Smear Slide Analysis** using traditional CV + deep learning  
- **End-to-End RAG Pipelines** with Ollama, Milvus, LangChain  
- **Transcription Engines** using Whisper + faster-whisper for large audio datasets  
- **CLI + UI Tools** for batch inference and visualization of AI predictions  
- **PDF + Image Document Processing** using PaddleOCR and OpenCV

## Personal Projects
-  [Travel Advisor - A React.js app that uses Firebase to show nearby attractions, hotels, and restaurants based on the user's location.](https://travel-advisor-jsmuneeb.netlify.app)
-  [Realm Rush - A Unity grid-based strategy game where players place crossbows to stop pathfinding enemies, manage currency, and survive escalating difficulty.](https://sharemygame.com/@Deathsmoke94/muneeb-s-realm-rush)
-  [AI Interview Coach - An AI-powered tool built on Gemini that analyzes your resume and job description to highlight strengths, identify gaps, and prepare you with personalized mock interviews.](https://ai-interview-coach-xx7qn6wlcihbou9fkkpnzt.streamlit.app)
   

## Tech Stack
